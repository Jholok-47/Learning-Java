1. Abstract keyword is used to declare a class or method as abstract. An abstract class cannot be
instantiated, and an abstract method must be implemented by subclasses. Only subclasses can be used to create
objects of an abstract class.
(Instantiated - created as an instance of a class.)

2. Super method is used to call a method from the parent class. It is often used in constructors to initialize
the parent class before adding additional functionality in the subclass.

3. Diamond problem - A situation in multiple inheritance where a class inherits from two classes that both
inherit from a common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity in method resolution. Java avoids this problem by
not allowing multiple inheritance of classes, but it allows multiple inheritance of interfaces.

4. Method of a subclass cannot return private members of the parent class.

5. Two things have to be same for method overriding. Name and return type. It's called a method's signature.

6. Abstract class means no objects can be created and abstract method means it cannot have any body.
An abstract class may not contain an abstract method. But an abstract method needs to be in an abstract class.

7. If change in one class should not affect other classes, then use interface. It's called coding against interface.
If change in one class can affect other classes, that point of affect is called coupling point.
