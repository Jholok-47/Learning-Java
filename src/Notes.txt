1. Abstract keyword is used to declare a class or method as abstract. An abstract class cannot be
instantiated, and an abstract method must be implemented by subclasses. Only subclasses can be used to create
objects of an abstract class.
(Instantiated - created as an instance of a class.)

2. Super method is used to call a method from the parent class. It is often used in constructors to initialize
the parent class before adding additional functionality in the subclass.

3. Diamond problem - A situation in multiple inheritance where a class inherits from two classes that both
inherit from a common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity in method resolution. Java avoids this problem by
not allowing multiple inheritance of classes, but it allows multiple inheritance of interfaces.

4. Method of a subclass cannot return private members of the parent class.
